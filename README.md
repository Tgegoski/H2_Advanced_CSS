A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point canâ€™t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

Portfolio shows examples of potential candidates work
When the portfolio loads it presents the developers name, and contact information
The portfolio has links to sections of their work
The UI scrolls to the corresponding section
The links to the sections of their work shows titled pages of their applications
When the link is clicked on for the first application then the image should be larger than the others
When the images are clicked on for each application then they are taken to the deployed site
The page is a responsive layout that adapts to each viewport
